# Time on Status Report Generator

This is a small python program to query the Intercom API for the admin activity logs, and compile the time on each status for the individual teammates in the app.
There are a few caveats with the data generated.
 - Because we infer the time on status from events, we can't know anything about the status of an admin until we see an event, so for all days in the range of days that you search for where an admin changed their status, their time on each status will be reported as 0.
 - Similar to the above, we infer teammates based on the activity events present. Therefore if a teammate does not update their status during the range of days search for, then they won't show up in this report at all.

 ## Installation
 This is configured as a python package.
 ```
 cd time_on_status
 pip install .
 ```

 **Note:** that in order to access the API for your intercom workspace, you need an access token. That token can be passed as a third argument on the command line, or as the environment variable "INTERCOM_API_TOKEN"
